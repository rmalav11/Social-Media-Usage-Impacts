**SOCIAL MEDIA USAGE AND ITS IMPACT ON STUDENTS**

This statistical analysis project examines the impact of social media on college students, and specifically focuses on how social media usage affects the studentsâ€™ well-being in different ways. The study collected data from 81 college students, out of which the majority attend Whitworth University. The survey collected their age, daily social media usage, and their responses to questions about the impact of social media on their everyday lives. The results of the study suggest that social media usage has a significant impact on the well-being of college students. The data revealed that students who spend more time on social media reported a higher frequency of procrastinating on school work and other responsibilities compared to those who spend less time on social media, this was more prevalent for males than females. 

Additionally, the study also investigated and found that while some students reported positive effects of social media on their lives, a larger proportion reported negative effects. The study also compared relationships between factors like number of hours spent using social media and its effect on students experiencing FOMO, how it affected comparison among college students. However, there was not enough evidence to prove any significant relationship between these factors. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the relationship between social media usage and the well-being of college students, and the findings suggest that while social media can have positive effects on the lives of some students, it can also have negative consequences, particularly for those who spend a significant amount of time on social media. The study also highlights the need for further research into the impact of social media on college students, and the development of interventions to mitigate any negative effects.
